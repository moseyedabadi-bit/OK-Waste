# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) – OK-Waste

---

## 1) What is the main objective of OK-Waste?
The core objective is to build a **responsible, traceable, and economically viable** waste management framework that:
- Rewards customers  
- Empowers drivers and operational teams  
- Supports charities  
- Protects the environment  

---

## 2) What is the difference between the pilot and the full-scale project?

- **Pilot Phase**  
  - Focus on **dry waste** collection at selected Ofogh Kourosh stores  
  - Store-level bins and loyalty point rewards  
  - Basic data collection and operational learning  

- **Full-Scale Phase**  
  - Door-to-door collection of **both dry and wet waste** using Okala vans  
  - Integration with hubs and BSF-based processing

---

## 3) How is the value of collected waste shared?

The default model:

- **80%** – Customer (or a charity chosen by the customer)  
- **15%** – Driver  
- **5%** – Company (Ofogh Kourosh / Okala)  

This model can be fine-tuned per city or pilot.

## 4) What happens to wet waste?

Wet waste is:

1. Collected and pre-sorted  
2. Stabilized (e.g., cooled, partially processed)  
3. Sent to BSF rearing facilities  
4. Converted into **larvae biomass**, which then becomes:
   - Animal feed protein  
   - Fat/oil  
   - Organic by-products (e.g., frass/compost)

---

## 5) Why BSF (Black Soldier Fly)?

Because BSF:

- Reduces the **volume of organic waste by up to 90%**  
- Produces high-quality local protein  
- Has a much lower environmental footprint compared to soy and fishmeal  
- Fits perfectly into circular economy models

---

## 6) What is the role of Okala drivers?

Drivers:

- Collect waste from households according to scheduled routes  
- Perform basic sorting and quality checks  
- Register customer rewards at the doorstep (QR / app / device)  
- Receive **15%** of the value of collected waste as an incentive

---

## 7) What happens in the hubs?

Okala hubs:

- Aggregate and weigh collected waste  
- Compact and bale dry materials  
- Pre-process wet waste for BSF or other processes  
- Ensure traceability and data collection for reporting (ESG / SDG metrics)

---

## 8) What is the current status of the project?

The project is currently at the **pilot-ready design** stage, with:

- Store-level pilot scenario defined  
- Logistics and hub concepts outlined  
- BSF integration designed at a conceptual level

---

## 9) What are the social benefits?

- New job opportunities (drivers, hub operators, BSF technicians)  
- Continuous funding channel for charities (e.g., children’s education)  
- Public education on waste sorting and environmental responsibility  
- Stronger brand reputation for Ofogh Kourosh, Okala, and Golrang
