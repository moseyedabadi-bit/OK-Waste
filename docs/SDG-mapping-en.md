# Mapping OK-Waste to UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

The **OK-Waste – Responsible Waste Management Framework** contributes directly and indirectly to several UN SDGs.  
This document highlights the most relevant SDGs and their linkage to the project.

---

## SDG 2 – Zero Hunger
**How OK-Waste contributes:**
- Production of **animal feed protein** from organic wet waste through BSF  
- Reduced dependency on imported soybean and fishmeal  
- Increased resilience and sustainability in local livestock and poultry value chains

---

## SDG 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation
**How OK-Waste contributes:**
- Diverts organic wet waste away from landfills and sewage systems  
- Reduces leachate and contamination risks for groundwater  
- Supports more hygienic urban waste management practices

---

## SDG 11 – Sustainable Cities and Communities
**How OK-Waste contributes:**
- Establishes a **formal and structured** collection network for household waste  
- Integrates retail stores and last-mile logistics into a circular urban ecosystem  
- Reduces pressure on municipal services and improves neighborhood cleanliness

---

## SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production (Core SDG)
**How OK-Waste contributes:**
- Encourages **source separation** of dry and wet waste by customers  
- Converts waste into measurable economic value for citizens and companies  
- Creates traceable ESG metrics for Ofogh Kourosh, Okala, and Golrang Group  
- Embeds circular thinking into the retail and logistics ecosystem

---

## SDG 13 – Climate Action
**How OK-Waste contributes:**
- Reduces methane emissions from landfilled organic waste  
- Lowers the carbon footprint of animal feed production  
- Promotes responsible logistics and optimized routing (less unnecessary trips)

---

## SDG 14 & SDG 15 – Life Below Water & Life on Land
**How OK-Waste contributes:**
- Decreases plastic and packaging leakage into nature and waterways  
- Reduces pressure on marine ecosystems by replacing fishmeal with BSF protein  
- Helps protect soil and biodiversity around landfills and urban peripheries

## Summary Table

| SDG  | OK-Waste Contribution                                      |
|------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| SDG 2  | BSF-based animal protein, reduced dependency on soy/fishmeal |
| SDG 6  | Controlled wet waste, protection of water resources      |
| SDG 11 | Structured urban waste collection and hubs               |
| SDG 12 | Circular economy, responsible production & consumption   |
| SDG 13 | Lower GHG emissions, improved climate impact             |
| SDG 14 | Less plastic in oceans, reduced fishmeal demand          |
| SDG 15 | Soil and biodiversity protection near landfills          |

## Conclusion
OK-Waste transforms a traditional retail and logistics network into a **circular, SDG-aligned ecosystem**, generating value for:

- The environment  
- The economy  
- The local communities  
- And future generations
