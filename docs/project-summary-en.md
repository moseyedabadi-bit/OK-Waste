# OK-Waste – Project Summary (EN)

## Introduction
**OK-Waste** is an innovative and data-driven framework for responsible dry and wet waste management across the **Ofogh Kourosh** retail network and the **Okala** logistics fleet.

The project is designed to transform waste from a cost and environmental burden into a **source of economic, social, and environmental value**, following the principles of the **Circular Economy**, **ESG**, and **UN SDGs** (particularly SDG 12).

---

## Why This Project Matters
- High volume of urban waste and the growing cost of landfilling and collection  
- Lack of a scalable and incentive-based model for citizen participation  
- Need for data-centric and traceable waste management in modern retail  
- Strong technical potential to convert wet waste into animal protein (via **BSF – Black Soldier Fly**)
- Opportunity to create a new, sustainable revenue stream for retailers, logistics fleets, and end-customers

---

## Vision
To build a **nationally scalable system** that:

- Converts waste into a **resource** instead of a problem  
- Turns the customer from a “pure consumer” into a **value co-creator**  
- Uses Ofogh Kourosh stores as initial collection nodes (pilot stage)  
- Uses Okala’s van network as a **door-to-door waste collection fleet**  
- Channels part of the generated value to **charity and social impact funds**  
- Links wet waste streams into **BSF-based animal protein production**

## Operational Structure

### 1) Pilot Phase – Ofogh Kourosh Stores
- 10–12 selected stores (starting with the Damavand cluster)  
- Installation of standard dry-waste collection bins  
- On-the-spot loyalty point rewards for customers  
- Staff training and customer education  
- Monitoring of waste quantity and quality

### 2) Scale-Up Phase – Okala Fleet Integration
- Launch of a **light van network** dedicated to waste collection  
- Door-to-door collection of dry and wet waste from households  
- Quick on-site separation and basic quality control  
- Daily transfer to Okala hubs  
- Real-time customer reward registration at the doorstep (QR / app / NFC)

### 3) Hub Operations
- Compaction and baling of dry waste (PET, metals, cartons, etc.)  
- Pre-processing of wet waste (size reduction, possible cooling, controlled storage)  
- Sending prepared wet waste to BSF rearing sites  
- Aggregated weighing, quality checks, and traceability

## Value Model

### Revenue Sharing
- **80%** – Customer (or charity selected by customer)  
- **15%** – Driver / vehicle operator  
- **5%** – Company (Ofogh Kourosh / Okala)

### Value Streams
- Recyclable materials: PET, aluminum, paper, cardboard  
- BSF-based animal protein and fat  
- By-products for compost or soil improvement  
- Brand equity and ESG reporting value

## BSF (Black Soldier Fly) Integration
Wet waste (with controlled moisture and contamination levels) is used as a high-quality substrate for **BSF larvae**.

**BSF cycle in this framework:**
1. Collection of wet waste  
2. Pre-processing and stabilization  
3. Feeding larvae at BSF farms (fixed or container-based mobile units)  
4. Harvesting larvae  
5. Drying and processing  
6. Producing **animal feed protein and fat**

Benefits:
- Up to **90% reduction** in the volume of wet waste  
- Local and sustainable protein source  
- Reduced dependency on imported soybean meal and fishmeal  
- Significant environmental footprint reduction

---

## Social Impact
- New job creation (drivers, hub staff, BSF technicians, store-level operators)  
- Direct support for charities (especially children’s education)  
- Public awareness and behavioral change in waste sorting  
- Stronger ESG positioning for Ofogh Kourosh, Okala, and Golrang

## Current Status
`Version 1.0 – Pilot-ready design (store-level + logistics concept)`
