# OK-Waste Whitepaper  
## Responsible Waste Management & Circular Economy Framework  
### Designed by Mostafa Seyedabadi

## 1. Executive Summary

OK-Waste is a comprehensive and scalable framework for **responsible dry and wet waste management** within the Ofogh Kourosh retail ecosystem and the Okala logistics network.

The project aims to:

- Turn waste into a measurable economic and social asset  
- Incentivize customers, drivers, and partners to participate  
- Integrate wet waste into **BSF-based protein production**  
- Align the entire system with ESG reporting and SDG targets  

---

## 2. Background & Problem Statement

### 2.1 Urban Waste Challenges
- Growing amounts of household waste in Iranian cities  
- Landfill overuse and environmental risks  
- Lack of granular, data-driven monitoring of waste streams  

### 2.2 Retail & Logistics Context
- Large-scale retail network (Ofogh Kourosh) with thousands of branches  
- Mature last-mile delivery system (Okala) with motorbike and van fleets  
- Strong loyalty programs but limited integration with waste/recycling incentives  

---

## 3. OK-Waste Concept

### 3.1 Core Idea
Use **existing retail and logistics infrastructure** as the backbone of a **circular waste management system**, where:

- Stores act as **collection points**  
- Vans act as **mobile collection units**  
- Hubs serve as **processing and aggregation nodes**  
- BSF units transform organic waste into animal feed protein  

### 3.2 Guiding Principles
- Circular economy and resource efficiency  
- Fair and transparent revenue sharing  
- Data-driven decision-making  
- Social impact and charity integration  

---

## 4. System Architecture

### 4.1 Store-Level Operations (Pilot)
- Customer brings dry waste to selected Ofogh Kourosh branches  
- Staff weigh and classify materials  
- Customer receives points in the loyalty app  
- Data is logged for analysis

### 4.2 Door-to-Door Collection (Scale-Up)
- Okala van routes are redesigned to include waste collection  
- Household scheduling via app / SMS / call center  
- Driver collects separated dry and wet waste  
- Customer points registered on the spot  

### 4.3 Hubs & Processing
- Hubs receive and aggregate waste from multiple routes  
- Dry waste is compacted and sold to recyclers  
- Wet waste is stabilized and sent to BSF facilities  

---

## 5. BSF Integration

### 5.1 Why BSF?
- High conversion rate of organic matter  
- Short production cycle  
- Strong global trend as alternative protein  

### 5.2 BSF Process Flow
1. Wet waste collection  
2. Pre-processing (grinding, mixing, moisture control)  
3. Feeding BSF larvae  
4. Harvesting  
5. Drying and milling to protein meal  
6. Quality assurance and packaging  

---

## 6. Economic Model

### 6.1 Revenue Streams
- Sale of recyclable dry materials  
- Sale of BSF-based protein and fat  
- Potential carbon credits and ESG reporting value  

### 6.2 Cost Structure
- CAPEX: bins, hubs, BSF units, IT systems  
- OPEX: drivers, staff, utilities, maintenance  

### 6.3 Revenue Sharing Model
- 80% Customer / Charity  
- 15% Driver  
- 5% Company  

(The exact ratios can be tuned per phase and region.)

---

## 7. SDG & ESG Alignment

- **SDG 2**: Alternative protein for animal feed  
- **SDG 6**: Better control of wet waste and water protection  
- **SDG 11**: More sustainable urban waste systems  
- **SDG 12**: Core responsible consumption and production  
- **SDG 13**: Reduced GHG emissions from waste and feed production  

Full mapping is documented in `SDG-mapping-en.md`.

## 8. Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1 – Pilot (Store-Level)
- 10–12 stores  
- Only dry waste  
- Baseline data on participation and volumes  

### Phase 2 – Logistics Integration
- Dedicated Okala van routes  
- Door-to-door waste collection  
- Hub infrastructure setup  

### Phase 3 – BSF Scale-Up
- Integration with 1–3 BSF farms or containerized mobile units  
- Product validation and feed market tests  

### Phase 4 – Nationwide Scaling
- Rollout across the Ofogh Kourosh network  
- Regional hubs and BSF sites  
- Continuous improvement based on KPIs  

---

## 9. Risks & Mitigation

- **Customer adoption risk** → handled via strong incentives and communication  
- **Operational complexity** → phased rollout, clear SOPs  
- **Regulatory risk** → ongoing alignment with local environmental and health regulations  
- **Market risk for BSF products** → diversification of offtakers in livestock and poultry sectors  

---

## 10. Conclusion

OK-Waste is not only a waste management project; it is a **platform for circular value creation** that:

- Unites customers, drivers, retailers, logistics fleets, and farmers  
- Links physical operations to ESG and SDG frameworks  
- Can be scaled across cities and potentially across countries
